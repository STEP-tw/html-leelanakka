    <h2><p>About STEP</p></h2>
    <h2><p>Step 1) Registration Form:</p></h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first step towards STEP is to visit on STEP
        website <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/STEP">link. </a> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here I fill up a small registration form online.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it require just basic information your Email
        ID(because all future communications &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with
        company are through email, so provide correct and active email id).<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to explain more about application
        process that website will tell you all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further
        details.

    <h2><p>Step 2) Detailed Application Form:</p></h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filling of Detailed Application Form online
        require more concentration because &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there
        were strict validations and one time submission is allowed <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means once the form is submitted to server we
        can't get it again.
      </p>
    </h3>
    <h2><p>Step 3) Online Aptitude Test:</p></h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some days I received admit card for online
        test through email. Online Test is to test verbal, logical and
        quantitative reasoning of candidates. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main point during exam is to consider time
        important and time management is the key to success. It is important to
        pass cut-off of all the three reasoning Commonly students
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fails in time management.
      </p>

    <h2><p>Step 4) Group Discussion and Personal Interview:</p></h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very cool and hyper less environment" is the
        speciality of ThoughtWorks Interview . GD & PI usually held up in their
        office branch . <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to crack these is that only perform
        according to their expectation- What they want? They don't want a
        candidate to be topper with high percentage mark sheet or high
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profile English speaking skills, they only want
        a candidates -who are willing to learn?, having general understanding of
        problem solving and logical thinking.
